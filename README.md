# learn-c
I felt like learning C and wanted to make a repo to track progress

### the #include <stdio.h> at the top of every c file is for standard input output library
### this allows you do do things like print things from the main function



### all code is written within the main function, and it is common to add return 0 at the end of it even though when you initialize the funcion you say it will the return type is void, in the result that the function returns anything other than 0 you will be able to easily tell something is wrong


### there is no string data type in c, so you must use an array of char, the syntax looks like char string[] = "this is a string"
### must use double quotes, single quotes are not an option
